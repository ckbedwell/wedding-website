    "question": "Masks",
    "answer": [
      "We have spoken to our venue and at present they have some rules for wearing a mask when entering the venue. These might change by September and we will clearly communicate this on the day, but please bring a mask just in case they have any rules still in place."

  {
    "question": "Checking in between the church and reception",
    "answer": [
      "The reception is 10 miles from the church (just under a 25-minute drive), so we've left enough time for guests to check-in to their accommodation after the ceremony.",
      "The ceremony starts at {{ceremonyStart}}, and the reception starts at {{receptionStart}}."

  {
    "question": "Parking",
    "answer": [
      "Both the church and the reception venue have lots of parking.",
      "You are able to leave your cars at the reception venue overnight. As most of you will likely be staying in hotels with other guests and friends, we recommend that you car share to the venue, take a taxi home that night and car share on the following day to retrieve your car."

  {
    "question": "Taxis",
    "answer": [
      "We advise pre-booking taxis when you will need them, especially after the reception, as we've been told getting a taxi after 11pm can be very difficult.",

    "question": "Gifts",
    "answer": ["Your presence is present enough, but if you would like to buy us a gift, we are always working on projects in our home. A contribution to this would be much appreciated as there is a never ending list of things we would love to do!"]
